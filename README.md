Music Generation Using RNN
This repository showcases a deep learning-based music generation system powered by Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). The project leverages LSTM or GRU architectures to learn temporal patterns in musical compositions, generating creative, stylistically coherent music.

Features
Sequential Pattern Learning: Predicts notes or chords based on temporal dependencies in musical sequences.
Real-Time Music Generation: Generates music dynamically, with customizable styles and seed sequences.
Advanced Preprocessing: Converts MIDI files into numerical representations for efficient model training.
Interactive Output: Produces MIDI files compatible with DAWs and MIDI editing software.
Scalability: Supports training on large datasets with efficient data handling and transfer learning.
Technologies Used
Deep Learning Framework: TensorFlow/Keras
Music Tools: PrettyMIDI, FluidSynth, and MIDI data processing libraries
Languages: Python
Installation
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/music-generation-rnn.git
cd music-generation-rnn
Install required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
(Optional) Install FluidSynth for audio rendering:

On Linux: sudo apt-get install fluidsynth
On Windows: Download FluidSynth
Download a soundfont file (.sf2) for audio rendering (e.g., GeneralUser GS SoundFont).

Usage
1. Data Preparation
Place your MIDI files in the data/midi folder.
Run the preprocessing script to convert MIDI into a usable format:
python preprocess.py
2. Train the Model
Train the RNN model on your MIDI dataset:
python train.py --epochs 50 --batch_size 64
3. Generate Music
Generate a new music sequence:
python generate.py --seed midi-seed-file.mid --output generated_music.mid
4. Convert to Audio
Convert the generated MIDI file to an MP3:
python midi_to_audio.py --input generated_music.mid --output generated_music.mp3 --soundfont path/to/soundfont.sf2
Folder Structure:
data/:
midi/: Folder for input MIDI files.
processed/: Folder for processed datasets.
models/: Contains trained models and checkpoints.
output/: Folder for generated MIDI and audio files.
scripts/: Contains scripts for preprocessing, training, and generation.
